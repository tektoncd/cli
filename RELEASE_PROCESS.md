# TektonCD CLI Release Process

- You need to be a member of tektoncd-cli [OWNERS](OWNERS) and be a member of the [CLI maintainers team](https://github.com/orgs/tektoncd/teams/cli-maintainers) to be able to push a new branch for the release and update the CLI Homebrew formula. 

- You will need to have a [GPG key set up](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification) with your git account to push the release branch.

- You need to have your own Kubernetes cluster with Tekton installed under `minikube`, `gcp`, or other means.

- Start reading this [README](tekton/README.md), and you can start a new release
  with the [release.sh](tekton/release.sh) script.

- Update the version numbers in the main [README.md](README.md) to the version you are releasing by opening a pull request to the master branch of this repository. Do not worry about updating the README for the release branch.

- When the release is done in https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases, edit the
  release and change it from pre-release as released.

- When it's released, you can build the rpm package according to this
  [README](tekton/rpmbuild/README.md) document. Make sure you have done the PREREQ to be
  able to upload it to the copr repository. This could take some time if copr
  builder is busy.

- While the rpm task is building the rpm package, you can start building the
  debian package according to this [README](tekton/debbuild/README.md)
  document. Make sure you have done the prerequist to be able to upload to the
  [launchpad team](https://launchpad.net/~tektoncd), and make sure as well that
  you have setup your GPG key and add it to your profile on launchpad.

- You need to edit the Changelog according to the other templates in there.
  Usually you may want to do this in hackmd so you can have other cli
  maintainers do this with you. You can see an example
  [here](https://gist.github.com/chmouel/8a837af3a592df47db9e81da8846c673).

- Get someone with OSX to test the `brew install tektoncd/cli/tektoncd-cli`

- Get someone with Fedora to test the RPM:

```shell
dnf makecache
dnf upgrade tektoncd-cli
```

- Make an update on [homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/tektoncd-cli.rb) for tektoncd-cli formula.

  * Make sure you get the proper `sha256sum`. You need to download the `Source Code (tar.gz)` from the [release section of the cli GitHub](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases) and run the command below for the release version you are working on:
  
    ```shell script
    sha256sum cli-0.7.1.tar.gz 
    ```
    
    You will get similar output to what is shown below:
    
    `72df3075303d2b0393bae9a0f9e9b8441060b8a4db57e613ba8f1bfda03809b5  cli-0.7.1.tar.gz`

  * Raise a PR to update like [this](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/46492) to Homebrew Core

- Make a version update to the test-runner and `tkn` image in the [plumbing](https://github.com/tektoncd/plumbing/) repo. The test-runner image is used to run the CI on the pipeline project, which uses `tkn`. For both Dockerfiles listed below, search for `ARG TKN_VERSION` in the Dockerfile for where to update the release version. Update the version arg to match the version of `tkn` released (i.e. `ARG TKN_VERSION=<RELEASED_VERSION>`).

  * [test-runner image](https://github.com/tektoncd/plumbing/blob/master/tekton/images/test-runner/Dockerfile) 

  * [tkn image](https://github.com/tektoncd/plumbing/blob/master/tekton/images/tkn/Dockerfile)

- Announce and spread the love on twitter. Make sure you tag
  [@tektoncd](https://twitter.com/tektoncd) account so you get retweeted and
  perhaps add the major new features in the tweet. See [here](https://twitter.com/chmouel/status/1177172542144036869) for an example.
  Do not fear to add a bunch of  emojis ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³. Ask @vdemeester for tips ðŸ¤£.

- Notify the cli channel on slack.
