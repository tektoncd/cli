# Release Notes

<!--
Does your PR contain User facing changes?

If so, briefly describe them here so we can include this description in the
release notes for the next release!

For pull requests with a release note:

```release-note
Your release note here
```

For pull requests that require additional action from users switching to the new release, include the string "action required" (case insensitive) in the release note:

```release-note
action required: your release note here
```

For pull requests that don't need to be mentioned at release time, use the `/release-note-none` Prow command to add the `release-note-none` label to the PR. You can also write the string "NONE" as a release note in your PR description:

```release-note
NONE
```
